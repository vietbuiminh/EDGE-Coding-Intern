    Entrepreneurial Development through Guided Experiences (which is a bit of a mouthful). EDGE connects students with community organizations in need of communications, marketing and creative services.

The students learn technical skills, build soft skills, and gain experience to enhance their portfolios and resumes. Businesses and not-for-profit organizations gain a low-cost resource for their marketing needs.

The EDGE Center opened in 2010 as an expansion of the Augustana Web Guild model, originally founded in 1997. The Web Guild is a self-funding student organization that provides website development services for small businesses and nonprofit organizations.
