                <h1>The Water &amp; Sanitation Industry Needs Women</h1>
                <p>While water and sanitation continues to be a male-dominated industry, the involvement of women in the management of water and sanitation is critical to water sustainability. Women are the primary users of water. They offer a unique perspective on water and sanitation challenges. Research indicates that when women are involved in water projects, the effectiveness of the project is 6-7 times higher than when women are not involved. Further, there are not enough interested men to satisfy the industry's future workforce demands. Women can fill this workforce gap just as they have done in other fields.<br><br>
                
                We are incredibly proud to say that the work we do at H<sup>er</sup><sub>2</sub>O&trade; significantly contributes to achieving United Nations' goals: SDG 5 gender equality and SDG 6 clean water and sanitation!<br><br>

                <h1>The Water &amp; Sanitation Crisis</h1>
                <p>Water is a limited resource. As the global population continues to grow at an ever-increasing rate, the demand for water and sanitation also increases. Effective and efficient water and sanitation management is imperative to safeguard global water sustainability and avert water crises.<br><br>
