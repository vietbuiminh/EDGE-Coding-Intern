            introduced in 1997. Proudly built and designed in the U.S.A. as quality and affordable by Bill Schwader, who
            has a background in auto racing starting in 1959. He was a driver/builder of stock cars and pulling trucks
            for over 40 years.</p>
        <p>E-Z Bend products were the first quality and affordable benders and brakes that allowed the racers and
            fabricators to build their own cars saving money and permitting them the flexibility to do it their way. E-Z
            Bend products have been sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe and Japan. They are available
            through our distributors or can be ordered direct from graymachinewelding.com. </p>
