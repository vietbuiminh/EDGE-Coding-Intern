        <h1 class="blue-background">Page Header</h1>
        <p>Hey there! This is representing your main content area. This is where you'll put most of the cool stuff that you're talking about. This is going to be a larger area on the website than the sidebar because...well this is the main content section, and your sidebar is just a sidebar! If you wanted pages with text that has cool asides, maybe a feature about a business with a sidebar that talks about the business owner, this would be just the ticket.</p>
        <p>Let's add a little more text here. After all, this is your primary content area! I want it to look like this is really the section that will have a lot more content in it than the other section on the page. I have to say, CSS Grid really has made this sort of thing far easier. It cuts down the amount of time and effort in making page layouts like this.</p>
        <p>Well, that's all I have right now. We'll see you in the next page template.</p>

  	<aside class="content-right blue-background">
            <h2>Subheader</h2>
            <p>Hey, look at me! I'm a sidebar. That means that I'm perfect for fun little bits of interesting, engaging content. Definitely keep my paragraph length short, though.</p>
            <p>Nobody wants to see long paragraphs in a sidebar like this. They get all squished skinny and long, and then the text really looks pretty strange. Just keep it nice and short.</p>
            <p>This is perfect for bite-sized bits of text and maybe some small photos.</p>
