    <h1>Bix Beiderbecke Museum</h1>
    <p>Visit the new BIX MUSEUM!<br><br>

    It's a must stop for jazz and history lovers. Visitors will learn of Bix Beiderbecke's brief beautiful life at the end of the 20th century, view rare films and listen to his in comparable music.<br><br>

    This museum (opened July, 2017) in Bix's hometown tells his story through recordings, photos, videos, storyboards, poignant letters, instruments used by colleagues and precious artifacts, including a baby grand piano from the N.Y.C. apartment where he died in 1931 at age 28.<br><br>

    The museum is located in the lower level of the River Music Experience (RME), at the corner of 2nd & Main in downtown Davenport (Iowa). Hours are 10 am to 5 pm, Monday - Friday and 10 am - 2 pm Saturday. Admission is free but donations are gratefully accepted.<br><br>
