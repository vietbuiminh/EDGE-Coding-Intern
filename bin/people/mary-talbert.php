    <p>Crafted QC is an Etsy page come to life. Here, you’ll find a beautiful space with all kinds of unique, handmade items. You can see and feel the originality all over the store. Crafted QC was started by Mary Talbert, a Davenport native and Iowa State University alum. She started her career working in AD agencies in Chicago as an art director in print and television. Eventually, she moved back to the QC taking a role as a graphic designer for the QC Chamber of Commerce. As amazing as that experience was, Mary always dreamed of opening up her own place. Mary believes that small businesses are what give a community its character and color. She says of course we need the Walmarts and Targets of the world, but they aren’t what you think of when you picture a city’s personality. From its humble beginnings as a 400 sq. feet workshop-studio combo to the lucrative business with over 130 artists across the country it is now, Crafted QC is a gleaming symbol of the vibrance small businesses bring to the quad-cities.<br><br>
