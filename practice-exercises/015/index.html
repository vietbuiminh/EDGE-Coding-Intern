                <h1>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h1>
                <p>Joel E. Lorentzen grew up on a small farm in eastern Iowa. Joelâ€™s family of seven lived the life of
                    the rural working poor, saved by the stubborn resolve of parents who refused to give up. A
                    scholarship permitted his Iowa State University education as an engineer, but his elective choices
                    were literature and creative writing. He later obtained an MBA from the University of Iowa. Joel
                    travelled the world extensively as an automation engineer for over 36 years. Along the way, he
                    invested in a variety of private manufacturing companies which he continues to serve as a
                    consultant, permitting his self-identified occupation as <q>semi-retired.</q><br><br>

                    Long plane rides and airport layovers served his passion for reading and writing. His background
                    provided a distinct sense of the travails and resilience of working people, those he recognizes as
                    the ones whose efforts really make the world go.<br><br></p>
