    <h1>Colors of the Rainbow</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website describing the colors of the rainbow.</p>

    <p>Everybody's heard of Roy G. Biv, right? In case you haven't, here's what it stands for:</p>

    <!-- <h2>Infrared</h2> -->
    <!-- <p>Nobody can see it, though... Aren't I clever?</p> -->

    <h2 id="red">Red</h2>
    <p>The color with the longest wavelength, from 622-780 nanometers. A nanometer is one to the ninth of a meter! Very
        small!</p>

    <h2 id="orange">Orange</h2>
    <p>Oranges are nice and they taste great. Have you had any oranges today?</p>

    <h2 id="yellow">Yellow</h2>
    <p>The color with the smallest margin of wavelength, from 577-597 nanometers.</p>

    <h2 id="green">Green</h2>
    <p>The color that is observed the best by the human eye. Have you ever looked at a green laser?</p>

    <h2 id="blue">Blue</h2>
    <p>A bit of a sad color. Doesn't blue make you sad?</p>

    <h2 id="indigo">Indigo</h2>
    <p><em><q>It is customary to list indigo as a color lying between blue and violet, but it has never seemed to me
                that indigo is worth the dignity of being considered a separate color.</q></em> - Isaac Asimov</p>

    <h2 id="violet">Violet</h2>
    <p>The color with the shortest wavelength, from 390-455 nanometers. Very fast!</p>

    <!-- <h2>Ultraviolet</h2> -->
    <!-- <p>These waves are even faster! But you can't see them, either.</p> -->

    <p>By the way, is light a particle or a wave?</p>
    <p><strong>Both</strong></p>
