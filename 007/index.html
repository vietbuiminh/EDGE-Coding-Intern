        <p>
            Welcome  to my site!  I’m honored you would take  one of your <br>
            irreplaceable commodities, your time, to check this out! <br>
            While  you are here, you can learn about...
        </p>

        <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
        <p>To change the landscape of eternity through words, actions, financial resources, and prayer</p>
        <h3>Thought for the Week</h3>
        <p>Time – such a  precious commodity. We can never &ldquo;get back&rdquo; time. I used to think this meant  time spent always had to be <i>productive</i>,<br>
            <strong>accomplishing</strong> <u>something</u>. Now I realize that time wasted is when I spent it not loving the  people I was interacting with or <br>
            appreciating all the blessings I was currently  enjoying – things like:
            <ol>
                <li>My sight</li>
                <li>My mobility</li>
                <li>My hearing</li>
            </ol> 
            What are you  taking for granted today? Take some <u><i><strong>TIME</strong></i></u> to stop and love on whoever is  in your presence this week and be grateful<br>
            for things you previously have taken  for granted.
