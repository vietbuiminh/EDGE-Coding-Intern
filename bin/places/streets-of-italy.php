    <p><i>Streets of Italy</i> specializes in authentic pizza, bringing the flavors of Italy to the Quad-Cities. Co-founder Mike Schaeffer says <q>Yeah, we have pizza but we sell stories along with it.</q> Mike is a Bettendorf native, raised on a farm only 2 miles from where <i>Streets of Italy</i> is located today. He had been in the hotel business for about 20 years, where he met his business partner that had spent a few years learning how to cook authentic dishes on the streets of Italy. They started small, only doing a few catering gigs but eventually, through word of mouth, they were doing 200 orders a year.<br><br>
    
    Mike recalls a time an Italian native described the experience by saying <q>If I had my eyes closed, I would think that I was in my hometown</q>. <i>Streets of Italy</i> is as close as you can get to Rome from the Quad-Cities short of a plane ticket. For a slice of authenticity, head down to <i>Streets of Italy</i> on 5th Ave.
