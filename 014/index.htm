                    <h2>Protect Your Investment</h2>
                    <p>Schools spend hundreds of thousands of dollars building and installing artificial sports fields.<br><br>
                    
                    Maintenance is essential to maximize your synthetic surface investment. The Riverbend Sports Turf team has the knowledge, equipment, and experience to help you realize that goal.</p>

                    <h2>Protect Your Athletes</h2>
                    <p>The athletes who use your turf train hard to perform at their optimum level. Their teams are outfitted in the most advanced, performance-enhancing gear and they are backed by trainers and support staff to keep them healthy and safe.<br><br>
                    
                    Does your turf do the same? In fact, the poorer the shock-attenutation on the turf, the more likely an athlete can be seriously injured upon impacting the ground.</p>
