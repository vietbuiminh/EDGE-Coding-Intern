    <p>Is Halloween your favorite holiday? Or do you just like spooky decorations? Well Igor’s Bistro in Rock Island, IL might be the perfect place for you! The month October is filled with candy, costumes, gore, ghosts, and goblins. And Halloween is a favorite among many including restaurant owners Rick and Kathy Lopez.<br><br>
    
    Igor’s Bistro is a restaurant owned by Halloween fanatics and married couple Rick and Kathy Lopez. Rick is the main Halloween and restaurant lover between the two. He has worked in the restaurant business since the 70’s and in the 1980’s Rick actually owned a restaurant named Aunt Mary’s. Kathy was born and raised in Moline. Even after living outside of the quad cities for a little while, she just had to come back because the quad city community is her home.<br><br>

    The restaurant is Halloween themed all year round and it is filled with spooky decorations and events. The decorations have been some Rick and Kathy have found themselves but many have actually been donations from different families. Every year the restaurant does a Trunk or Treat event, tarot card readings and they also do Halfway to Halloween parties (which actually includes a DJ, games and Thriller dancers!). The couple also fully encourages guests to wear costumes. No matter what time of the year! And completely fitting with the essence of the restaurant, Igor’s Bistro has professional paranormal confirmation of multiple ghosts in their restaurant! They are featured in a book called “Haunted places in the QC” which is on display in the restaurant.<br><br>

    Igor’s menu items don’t fail to keep up the spooky theme. They have many clever names such as Vampire Bites and Zombie Fingers. Rick is the main cook of the restaurant, as food is his love and dream. The bistro prides themselves on the quality of their ingredients, good service and the deliciousness of their food. Some of the menu favorites include chili, french onion soup, Italian beef, jack shrimp, and biscuits and gravy. <br><br>
