    <p>The Quad Cities is the home to many cool and unique coffee shops, bars, and drive thrus. Dead Poet's Espresso is nothing short of amazing! Dead Poet's Espresso is a coffee shop in Moline open everyday except Sunday. The shop features medium and dark roast coffee with flavors from up North in Door County, Wisconsin. They also have a specialty drinks menu and they serve breakfast and lunch.<br><br>
    
    Charles Lahl, the current owner of Dead Poet's, inherited the business from his father who bought it in his retirement. He comes from Bluegrass, Iowa and his favorite thing about the Quad Cities is how all the different communities can come together. The name of the shop was given by the original owners who named it after the movie <i>Dead Poets Society</i> (which is a movie Charles really likes). The shop is hopping with business at the early segment of the day (between 8-10) as people are heading to work. The rest of the day is pretty chill and is the perfect environment for studying and relaxing.<br><br>
    
    Dead Poet's is always adding new menu items and updating the menu every year. They have monthly special drinks and menu items. Their chicken salad is the most popular food item but they also have wraps and breakfast sandwiches. Something cool about the shops is that the local fire department and mayor come in for drinks. So, itâ€™s a cool place to meet a lot of new people. In addition, Dead Poet's is student friendly! Students get 10% off orders and obviously the shop has a lot of caffeine to get you through studying for that next test. Go on out and support your local business by checking out Dead Poet's Espresso!</p>
