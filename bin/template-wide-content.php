<section class="content-wide">
    <h1 class="blue-background">Page Header</h1>
    <p>Some sample content here to show you what it will look like with some text added. Stuff here. Yay fun more text. Hello, this is a sentence that is holding space on the page. Wow, with enough of these sentences put together, I might even get close to a whole paragraph. Paragraphs are good because they convey a lot of content.</p>
    <p>Look at that! I started a new paragraph of text! What a great day. It would be an even better day if it featured Reese's peanut butter cups. Unfortunately, I think my entire stash of Reese's is at the office, and of course I am working from home. In hindsight, I should have bought some before going into isolation for a couple of weeks.</p>
    <p>Theoretically, I could go buy some. After all, other people are leaving their houses and going to the stores. But come on, people. Staying at home - and working from home - for a couple weeks REALLY is not the end of the world. I can forego Reese's peanut butter cups for another little while.</p>

<section class="content-wide blue-background">
    	<h2>Subheader</h2>
        <p>You know, I should have some alternating white and blue background sections, just like on the home page. I think that would be pretty snazzy. The only problem is that I need to put some placeholder text into this section as well.</p>
        <p>Maybe we will make this a couple short paragraphs. That way I don't have to try to make up nearly as much text as I did for the previous section. After a while, the stream of consciousness starts to slow a bit, and then I have to start racking my brains for text to add. I'd rather just keep this one short and move on to making templates for the other page styles.</p>
