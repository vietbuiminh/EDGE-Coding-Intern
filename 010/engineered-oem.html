            <p>Many challenges are faced when manufacturing products that requires the assembly of large diameter nuts and bolts.  When using a turn torque solution, high preloads are not easily met or controlled because of the logistical and ergonomic challenges of fastening in these applications.  Controlling preload is limited to 25% accuracy at best, when all torque procedures are being followed without any error.<br><br>
            
            Superbolt was the world’s first to revolutionize nuts and bolts with multi-jackbolt tensioning technology. Since then, our technology has been proven in tens of thousands of successful installations and we continue to develop a multitude of solutions to solve the next generation of bolting challenges. By using zero friction mechanical tensioning, bolts stretch under pure tension without any torque wind up, resulting in a safe, fast and accurate way to control preload in a tight tolerance around 10% accuracy.</p>
            <h2>Common Applications for Mechanical Tensioners</h2>
            <p>Below are some of the industries and applications where mechanical tensioners are used throughout industry both OEM and Aftermarket.  In many instances, our OEM business results from solving a challenge for the end user in the field.  The combination of installation labor savings, increased quality control and reduced risk of injury provides many opportunities for mechanical tensioners to provide cost savings in your operation.</p>

This method required 1-2 shifts (sometimes three) with three workers for installation or removal. Occasionally a nut would seize and would require destructive removal. For this boiler feed pump, MJTs were installed using ½-inch impacts for initial tightening, and calibrated torque wrenches for the final torque step. Two workers were utilized for the installation which required about fifteen minutes to spin the tensioners into position, and one hour and twenty-one minutes to tighten. This was a significant time savings versus the previous method.</p>

            <h1>Hydraulic Nut Tensioners by Nord-Lock Group</h1>
            <p>Hydraulic nuts enable large diameter bolts to be tensioned with ease to high and accurate preloads. A hydraulic pump activates the internal jacking system, so the effort required to tighten a very large diameter bolt is reduced to the effort needed to operate the pump.<br><br>
            
            As there is no nut rotation during tightening, the operation can be performed in a confined space and torsional stresses on thread damage are eliminated. Any number of hydraulic nuts can be connected together for simultaneous operation, ensuring all bolts in the joint can be evenly loaded to the same high and accurate preload.</p>

            <h1>EXPANDER Pivot Pin Technology by Nord-Lock Group</h1>
            <p>Lug wear is a common problem with all machinery. Repairs involve a costly, time-consuming process with significant downtime and must be repeated several times over a machine’s life.<br><br>
            
            With the Expander System, the repair can be carried out directly in the worn mountings without welding and line boring – a permanent solution to lug wear.</p>

            Expander System is used by many OEMs, including Caterpillar, Komatsu, Volvo and John Deere.</p>
            <h2>Case Study</h2>
            <p><strong>Customer:</strong> BLACKWELL, PART OF HARGREAVES SERVICES PLC<br>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> EXPANDER SYSTEM<br>
            <strong>Business:</strong> EARTHWORKS CONTRACTORS<br>
            <strong>Project:</strong> HOUSE OF WATER COAL MINE, SCOTLAND<br>
            <strong>Challenge:</strong> REDUCING DOWNTIME DURING MAINTENANCE<br>
            <strong>Application:</strong> TRUCK SUSPENSION LEG MOUNTINGS AND HOIST MOUNTINGS<br>
            <strong>Time saves:</strong> DOWNTIME REDUCED FROM DAYS TO A FEW HOURS<br><br>
            
            After many hours of operation in the abrasive conditions of a gran¬ite quarry, the truck had suffered significant wear in its suspension lug mountings and hoist mount¬ings, and required maintenance work.  Because of the design of the Caterpillar 777G, line boring would have required removal and storage of the rear wheels. As each wheel weighs 4 tonnes, it is a manually intensive and risky job.<br><br>
            
            Furthermore, line boring is a costly, disruptive and time-consuming process that had been an integral part of Blackwell’s business for decades due to the use of regular straight pins. At a modern mine, every minute of lost production costs money, so to keep production going, replace¬ment machines were brought in, which increases complications and expenses. When Expander System approached the compa¬ny with an alternative, they were happy to try it.<br><br>

            During the installation of the new pins, the heavy rear wheels of Blackwell’s 777G could stay in place, which alone saved several hours.<br><br>
            
            “With the Expander System, downtime was reduced from days to just a few hours,” says Blackwell Plant Manager, David Lancashire. “While it’s too early to judge the long-term savings, the system has already given us impressive savings in both time and money.”<br><br>
            
            The Expander System also increases the lifecycle of the joint up to 50,000 hours. After a positive start with the system, Blackwell recently used it on a wheeled loader and are look¬ing to increase its use as a repair option on their extensive fleet.</p>

            <h1>DTI Smart-Bolts - Direct Tension Indicating</h1>
            <p>Confirming and maintaining tension of fasteners can be a timely but critical job for many manufactures. Using expensive tools and measuring equipment have their place but often lead to problems when customers are maintaining equipment in the field.  DTI (Direct Tension Indicating) Smart Bolts directly correlate fastener tension with color. Accuracy and reliably is ensured because the color change of the DTI Visual Indication System™ is proportional to fastener stretch — the only true measure of how tight your joint is (torque readings can be misleading since torque only measures how difficult it is to turn the bolt head).<br><br>
            
            The Smart Bolts built-in visual tension indicator turns from red to black when proper tension has been reached — and is completely reversible for the life of the fastener.</p>
            <img class="flex" src="http://aehh.net/images/indicators-poster-1.png" alt="Umatched Benefits of Industrial Indicators">
            <h2>How do DTI SmartBolts work?</h2>
            <p><img class="poster" src="http://aehh.net/images/visual-bolt-tension-indicators.png" alt="Visual Bolt Tension Indicators" align="right">The visual indicator in a DTI SmartBolt gradually changes color according to the amount of tension that is applied to the bolt. The visual indicator is black when Design Tension is reached and red when loose. This color change provides a real-time indication of bolt tension.</p>
            <img class="flex" src="http://aehh.net/images/indicators-poster-2.png" alt="Visual Indication System from Industrial Indicators">
            <p><strong>Can the DTI Visual Indicator be designed into any type of fastener?</strong><br>
            DTI SmartBolts are available in a wide range of fastener types and sizes. Please review the Fastener Size Ranges table for additional information. If you have a requirement that is not listed in the table, please contact us to discuss availability.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Can I use normal tools with DTI SmartBolts?</strong><br>
            Yes! DTI SmartBolts are designed to be used with the same tools you’re already using to install and maintain your bolted joints. In cases where the indicator is covered with a tool during use, we recommend tightening the DTI SmartBolt in stages to check the indicator and prevent overtightening.</p>
            
            <h2>DRI Visual Indication System</h2>
            <p>The DTI Visual Indication System™ continuously measures and displays tension information. From loose to tight and back again, the system is reliable and repeatable through countless cycles of operation. It is compatible with a wide range of fastener types, and we can adapt it to fasteners of nearly every available grade, finish, and coating.</p>
            <img class="flex" src="http://aehh.net/images/indicators-poster-3.png" alt="Visual Indication System from Industrial Indicators">
            <p>Their engineering team can design the DTI Visual Indication System to meet the specific requirements of your application. During the design phase, a Design Tension is specified. The Design Tension identifies a properly tightened SmartBolt.</p>
            <img class="flex" src="http://aehh.net/images/indicators-poster-4.png" alt="Specific details from Industrial Indicators">
            <p><strong>Do DTI SmartBolts indicate tension or torque?</strong><br>
            The DTI SmartBolt indicator measures tension. When a bolt is tightened, it is forced to stretch. This stretching force on a fastener is also called tension. Tension creates the clamp force that holds your bolted joints together.</p>

            <h1>HEICO-LOCK® RING LOCK WASHERS</h1>
            <img style="width: 10em;" src="heico_ring_lock.jpg" alt="heico ring lock"/>
            <p><strong>HEICO-LOCK® Ring Lock Washers provide high-quality, user-friendly bolt securing for the most demanding of applications and are ideal for repeated use.</strong><br>
                The ring locking system guarantees that the two wedge lock washers are always fastened in the correct position with the wedge shaped cams on the inside and the radial teeth on the outside. This means that the bolt locking system is always easy, safe and quick to install, even for non-specialist users.
            </p>
            <h3>DESIGN OF THE RING LOCKING SYSTEM</h3>
            <p>HEICO-LOCK® Ring Lock Washers are supplied pre-assembled. The ring locking system consists of a polyamide ring (PA) and the already familiar HEICO-LOCK® Wedge Lock Washers.
                <ul>
                    <li>Very easy to install and remove (ring locking system is supplied pre-assembled)</li>
                    <li>Whereas the HEICO-LOCK® Wedge Lock Washers secure the bolted connections reliably,
                        the ring holds the two individual washers together in the correct position permanently</li>
                    <li>Particularly suitable for dynamic loads – including when lubricants are used</li>
                    <li>Also suitable for use with high-tensile bolts of 8.8, 10.9 and 12.9 and their respective nuts</li>
                    <li>Available from M4 – M24 - custom sizes upon request</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
